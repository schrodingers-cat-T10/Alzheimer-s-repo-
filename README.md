# Face Recognition System for Alzheimer's Aid

## Overview

This repository contains a **Face Recognition System** designed to assist individuals with Alzheimer's disease. The system helps in recognizing and storing information about people, which can be particularly useful for Alzheimer's patients who may have difficulty remembering names, faces, and other personal details.

The system uses a combination of **face recognition**, **speech recognition**, and **MongoDB** for data storage. It captures images from a webcam, recognizes faces, and stores or retrieves personal information based on the recognized face.
